# DTXOrganizer

## Working

* Go over all songs in a directory and see if there are missing `SET.def` files.
* Create `SET.def` files when they are missing by using `.dtx` files.
* Change song directory name
* Progress bar.

## Pending

* Detect & fix broken links to files from `.dtx` files.
* Detect newly added songs (need DB).
* Grouping of songs by criteria (first letter name) and change their directories.
* Export songs data to spreadsheet and wishfully be able to modify data from spreadsheet (sort of sync).
* Argument parser to indicate actions to take (instead of modifying the code ugh).
